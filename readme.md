# Timeline and Stacked Chart

I developed these charts as a simple tool for project management and time tracking. It is based on [d3.js](http://d3js.org), and [d3-tip.js](https://github.com/Caged/d3-tip) for tooltip.

## An interactive stacked chart
Data are presented in a successive order arranged by group type to facilitate comparison between data groups. In this example, there are 4 data groups, Team A, B, C and D, with 3 types of work: time spent on projects, time spent on internal work, and available time left. Data is sorted and visualized in an interactive way with colors to ease interpretation of data.

## An interactive timeline chart
Data are plotted on a time period using start date and end date. It allows time tracking of each project to be more efficient than conventional graph. Interactive form of this data visualization technique provides more information on each period of project, such as project description or a link to related website. It also supports subseting function in order to tailor to one's specific interest.
